I really should start making a list of essential programs for me

terminal
files
browser

important utils
xfce4-power-manager - power management/behaviors and brightness control
lxqt-policykit (run with lxqt-policykit-agent)
kmix - volume keys
nitrogen - wallpaper control
polybar - polybar lol
picom jonaburg - have to make from git repo

terminal utils - 
zoxide - really fucking awesome directory navigation,
 suuuuper easy, you can move laterally in literally 3 keypresses
mc - file manager, probably really efficient
tmux - idk if i'm going to use this much as I'm
already in a tiling WM but it's cool, potentially super useful
fzf - realllly nice finder, helps the theme script
theme-selector script - find online, "terminal agnostic"
rofi - best application switcher/launcher/menu/finder/thing of all, super awesome
 - rofi-network-manager script
starship prompt - really nice
code - current ide, might try to switch to vim, who knows. I'll have to play with ricing it up first


misc general pc utils
eog - image viewer
